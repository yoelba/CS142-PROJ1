Ideas:
  STL find to find <a characters
    PUT IT IN BUFFER CONSTRUCTOR
    Reformat text of entire file when we shove it in that buffer 
      Someone comes up with formatting function?
    Store file names in a vector of strings
      Or a map? Map sounds good
  new command to say "gimmie that link"
  
  
  Name and Coding Conventions
    "Source text" vs "buffer text"
    We'll each have our very own branch
