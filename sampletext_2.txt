After a few <a nothing.txt computer> science <a courses.txt courses,>
students may start to get the feeling that programs can
always be written to solve any computational problem.
Writing the program may be hard work. For example, it
may involve learning a difficult
<a difficult_techniques.txt technique.> And many hours
of debugging. But with enough time and effort, the
program can be written.
So it may come as a surprise that this is not the case:
there are computational problems for which no program
exists. And these are not illâˆ’defined problems (Can a
computer fall in love?) or uninteresting toy problems.
These are precisely defined problems with important
practical <a applications.txt applications.>
