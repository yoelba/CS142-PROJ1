The program fulfills all of the requirements detailed in the project specification.
  o The program has been tested with a web of example files, including anchor statements.
    some files had many lines, some had very long lines, some had several line breaks, etc.
  o The "go" command, "reformatting" based off of anchors in a file, and line break formatting
    all appear to work properly.
  o In particular, special care was taken to ensure that several anchor statements could exist on
    the same line, that anchors could link to txt files with or without a .txt file extension,
    and that the code would handle errors well without crashing.

Certain details, however, must be noted:
  o In the event of a line's first word being larger than the specified line length,
    the entire line will be printed.
  o Anchors cannot be split over multiple lines: each anchor in a file must exist across a single line.
  o Optimization of code was limited due to time constraints - certain parts of the program could almost certainly
    stand to improve from some extra attention.
    
Remaining design flaws:
  o If user inputs line_length as less than 29, the program will enter an infinite loop.
    nobody knows why. As such, the program has been equipped with an input handler that
    prevents the user from inputting a line_length less than 29. 
  
Looking ahead:
  o The design of this program was managed in a github repository, which the group found
    very useful for incrementation and sharing purposes. We will likely use it again for
    future assignments.
  o Future programs could benefit from increased modularity - group members found themselves working on
    one another's code fairly regularly, despite efforts to prevent this when drafting the programs'
    design.
